## @downvote2donate
Mention me, I'll create a post explaining that, **if you downvote my posts, you donate to the group they're in.**

Mention me whenever you think a group needs some donations!

## Why?
Quite some time ago I took a look at [zapread.com's GitHub repo](https://github.com/Horndev/zapread.com).

```
100 satoshi down vote:
[...]
80 goes to group
10 goes to community
10 goes to zapread
```

**80 goes to group**
When I saw this, I had the idea for this bot.
