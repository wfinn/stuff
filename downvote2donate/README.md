## @downvote2donate
Mention me whenever you think a group needs some donations!  
I'll reply with a comment you can downvote.

## Why?
Quite some time ago I took a look at [zapread.com's GitHub repo](https://github.com/Horndev/zapread.com).

```
100 satoshi down vote:
[...]
80 goes to group
10 goes to community
10 goes to zapread
```

**80 goes to group**

## ...
I simply look for new messages every 20 minutes, so don't expect me to be fast.  
I might even be offline,  **this no serious bot / service** (yet?).


## Todo
- Mention group name in comment
