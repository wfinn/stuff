# shmd: shell to markdown
Use markdown in comments of shell scripts.

Then convert the script to md with shmd.

This basically justs puts everything but comments inside ```.
You can use # before every line or : ' to begin and ' to end a comment block, they won't be visible.

Might be useful for things like bug reports.

Ideas:
- Use <<something for special blocks? or <<htmltag?
- Rewrite in shell
